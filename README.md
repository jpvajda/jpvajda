### About Me:

Hey there! 👋

I'm an entrepreneur, startup veteran, product manager, and developer who thrives at the intersection of code and community.

I've worn many hats: launched my own products, taken ideas from 0 to 1, and rolled up my sleeves as a hands-on engineer. My sweet spot? **Developer Relations, Developer Experience, and building products developers actually love.**

If it involves helping developers build better things—count me in.
